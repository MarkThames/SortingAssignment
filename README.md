# Sorting Assignment for ICS4U

Goal: To compare quicksort and timsort, written in Java

## Quicksort

A commonly used sort, which has average time complexity O(N log N), and worst case O(N log N). The implementation used here picks the right-most element as the pivot, and then recursively calls quicksort on the two partitions.

## Timsort

A varient on mergesort, with best case O(N), and worst case O(N log N). This sort is based on the idea of mergesort. The implementation here uses an FIFO data structure to implement the sort.
